TODO List

- Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
- Random Player (chooses moves randomly)
- Timekeeping (execution time)
- More statistics/metrics
- Organize codebase (.cpp and .h folders, build folder, more complex makefile, etc.)
- Prettify/color-code command line output
- Perfect Player (via minimax)
- Smarter weight crossover
- Coevolution
- Keep population diverse (to prevent sub-optimal strategies)
- SFML (Simple Fast Media Library) pretty visualization
- Interactive training/playing in SFML
- Monte Carlo for predicting moves
- NEAT (evolve NN topology)
- Use TensorFlow
- Multi-threading
